# How to Use Juopunutbear S-OFF Tool to Unlock HTC Sensation Bootloader on Windows
  
If you own an HTC Sensation and want to root it or install custom ROMs, you need to unlock its bootloader first. However, the official HTCDev method may not work for some devices or firmware versions. In that case, you can use an alternative tool called Juopunutbear S-OFF, which can unlock the bootloader of any HTC Sensation with HBOOT 1.27.0000 or higher.

In this article, we will show you how to use Juopunutbear S-OFF tool to unlock HTC Sensation bootloader on Windows. This method does not require any HTCDev account or registration, and it works for both ICS and Gingerbread firmware. However, it does involve some risks and may void your warranty, so proceed at your own caution.
  
## Requirements
  
- A Windows PC with .NET Framework 4.0 or higher installed.
- A USB cable to connect your HTC Sensation to your PC.
- A microSD card with at least 4GB of free space.
- A paper clip or a similar metal object to short-circuit the SD card slot.
- The latest version of Juopunutbear S-OFF tool, which you can download from [here\[^1^\]](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-juopunutbear-s-off-no-htcdev-unlock-root-1-2x-hboots-new-one-click-root.1661631/page-32) or [here\[^2^\]](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-juopunutbear-s-off-hboot-1-27-0000-with-3-32-ics-firmware.1614617/).
- The latest HTC drivers for your device, which you can download from [here](https://www.htc.com/us/support/software/htc-sync-manager.aspx).
- A backup of your data, as this process will wipe your device.

## Steps

1. Extract the Juopunutbear S-OFF tool zip file on your PC and run the ControlBear.exe file as administrator.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to prepare your device for S-OFF. This will include enabling USB debugging, turning off fastboot, rebooting into bootloader mode, and selecting fastboot option.
3. Connect your device to your PC via USB cable and wait for the tool to recognize it.
4. When prompted, insert the microSD card into your device and format it as FAT32.
5. When prompted, remove the battery from your device and short-circuit the SD card slot using the paper clip. You need to touch the metal part of the paper clip to the metal part of the SD card slot for a few seconds until you see a green LED on your device.
6. When prompted, reinsert the battery and press the power button to boot into Juopunutbear mode. You will see a Juopunutbear logo on your screen.
7. Wait for the tool to flash a custom recovery and root your device. This may take several minutes.
8. When prompted, reboot your device normally. You should see a Superuser app in your app drawer.
9. Check your bootloader status by rebooting into bootloader mode again. You should see \*\*\*UNLOCKED\*\*\* at the top of the screen.

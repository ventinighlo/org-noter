ShineOff is a plugin that detects the glare of the flash and other light sources on human skin and transforms it to a soft and natural looking texture. It does not affect the luster of the lips, the sparkle of the eyes, or the shine of the hair. You can adjust the amount of the effect with a slider or use the default value of 75%.
 
PearlyWhites is a plugin that automatically whitens and brightens the teeth of your subjects. It does not affect the color of the lips, gums, or tongue. You can also adjust the amount of the effect with a slider or use the default value of 50%.
 
Both plugins are compatible with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and higher versions, Photoshop Elements 2 and higher versions, and PaintShop Pro 7 and higher versions. They also support RGB image modes with 8 bits and 16 bits per channel.
 
To use these plugins, you need to download and install them from the Image Trends website[^2^]. After that, you can find them under the Filter menu in Photoshop. You can apply them to your images individually or create an action to batch process multiple images at once.
 
Here are some examples of how these plugins can improve your portraits:

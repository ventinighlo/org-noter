## What is Mazetools Soniface (Lab Edition)?
 
Mazetools Soniface (Lab Edition) is a desktop version of the Mazetools Soniface app, which is available for iOS and Android devices. The app was developed by Stephan Kloss and Jakob Gruhl, who are music, art and technology enthusiasts. They have been doing independent research on music, art and technology since 2013[^1^].
 
Mazetools Soniface (Lab Edition) is a sonic and visual exploration tool that lets you create your own soundscapes and audiovisual performances. You can use the Grid-Synth, which is a visual grid synthesizer that plays tones based on the shape and color of the lines. You can also use the Sampler, which lets you loop soundscapes and tunes from native and user samples. You can also use the Rhythm Interface, which includes a step sequencer, modulation, envelope and effect modules. You can switch between Bass/Synth mode and Drum mode for the Rhythm Interface. You can also use the Granular Synth, which lets you transform samples into endless soundscapes[^2^].
 
You can control and modulate all these instruments with the Hyperface Performance Controller, which is a multitouch interface that lets you play with different sequence speeds, dynamic envelopes, filter curves and audio effects. You can also use the Main FX Controller, which includes Filter-Echo, Filter-Reverb, Flanger and Reverser. You can also use the Color Sequencer, which lets you create chord and note sequences based on colors[^2^].
 
One of the unique features of Mazetools Soniface (Lab Edition) is the visual interface, which lets you create sophisticated geometric shapes with up to 3 separate outputs. You can design your own visuals with different colors, shapes, sizes and animations. You can also use the surround sound output to extend your sets to 5.1 and 7.1 speakers and create spatialized soundscapes[^2^].
 
You can save your sessions as project files, main sound recordings, internal mic recordings or user samples. You can also import sessions from the mobile Soniface versions to the Lab version for further arrangement. You can also sync your sessions with other music apps using MIDI input, Ableton Link or Bluetooth[^2^].
